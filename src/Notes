battle ship rules:

Starting a New Game:
Each player places the 5 ships somewhere on their board.  The ships can only be placed vertically or horizontally.
Diagonal placement is not allowed. No part of a ship may hang off the edge of the board.
Ships may not overlap each other.  No ships may be placed on another ship.
Once the guessing begins, the players may not move the ships.

The 5 ships are:  Carrier (occupies 5 spaces), Battleship (4), Cruiser (3), Submarine (3), and Destroyer (2).

Playing the Game
Player's take turns guessing by calling out the coordinates. The opponent responds with "hit" or "miss" as appropriate.
Both players should mark their board with pegs:  red for hit, white for miss. For example, if you call out F6 and your opponent
does not have any ship located at F6, your opponent would respond with "miss".  You record the miss F6 by placing a white peg on
the lower part of your board at F6.  Your opponent records the miss by placing.

When all of the squares that one your ships occupies have been hit, the ship will be sunk.   You should announce "hit and sunk".
 In the physical game, a red peg is placed on the top edge of the vertical board to indicate a sunk ship.

As soon as all of one player's ships have been sunk, the game ends.

Ideas:
-show the board after each placement
-10 by 10 board
-turns automatically
-"~" is an empty space
- carrier is represented by 5, battleship is 4, cruiser is 3, submarine is 2, and destroyer is 1
-board is 2d array, misses would be printed as an array
-hits turn to * and misses to 0
-if no certain number print that it was sunk and also set has*insert boat name* to false
- setting period at the start where you pace ships
-have vertical and horizontal option when placing ships which would use either row column or column row to check if empty
